# Web-Browser-Password-Grabber
Rubber ducky payload that downloads WebBrowserPasswordView file and screenshots / duplicates the passwords. Works for Windows 10.

Note:

This payload will only work IF:
  * The pc is running on windows 10
  * Windows Defender is disabled
  * There is no sophisticated antivirus installed.
 
 Runview:

This payload works by disabling windows defender, downloading an app that views all 
saved passwords on all browsers. The payload then screenshots the interface, and 
then copy-pastes all of the data. It then emails you all of the files that were created, 
removes powershell history & the payload, and then shut's down the pc.
